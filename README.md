- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kamsamuel
- 👀 I’m interested in creating software that advances the developer's (myself included) creative process and time management while designing apps in C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .net along with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve those who want to change the perception of technical and creativity aspect of programming, and intertwine the two elements.
- 📫 How to reach me: collectivesounds808@gmail.com
